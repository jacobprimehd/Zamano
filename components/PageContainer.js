        <h1 className="text-center">I am lucky, but not just lucky more than that! I really got to know a beautiful girl from daily phone calls. These phone calls would last more than 3+ hours, talking or even being silent knowing each other is there on the other side.  After a while, our connection changed from what I felt, It went from getting to know each other to a great connection. It first started with flirting then, a sign popped up from Tiktok.

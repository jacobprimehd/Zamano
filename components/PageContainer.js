        <h1 className="text-center">I am lucky, but not just lucky, more than that! I really got to know a beautiful girl from daily phone calls. These phone calls would last more than 3+ hours, talking or even being silent knowing each other is there on the other side.  After a while, our connection changed from what I felt, It went from getting to know each other to affectionate. It first started with flirting, then it became continuous and normal. We started talking about what we want to see in our futures and goals. For example in the next 5 years, about marriage and etc. I found that talk very nice and comforting because we have some ideal goals that fit together.

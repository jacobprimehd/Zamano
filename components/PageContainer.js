        <h1 className="text-center mb-10">I am lucky, but not just lucky, more than that! I really got to know a beautiful girl from daily phone calls. These phone calls would last more than 3+ hours, talking or even being silent knowing each other is there on the other side.  After a while, our connection changed from what I felt, It went from getting to know each other to affectionate. It first started with flirting, then it became continuous and normal. We started talking about what we want to see in our futures and goals. For example in the next 5 years, about marriage and etc. I found that talk very nice and comforting because we have some ideal goals that fit together. After that day, I could not stop thinking about you, it just felt weird not thinking about you. At work in the mornings, waking up seeing all those messages and videos just makes my day. I look forward to waking up from what you send me, I just wish I could be there and hold you physically. You are a very sweet and caring person and itâ€™s a trait that pops out from you. You say very nice things, and just being there for me. No matter how horrible my day is, when I talk to you or text, it always brings my mood up. Ramla I know you expect more, but I would rather give you something shorter with more affection. I really like you, and do not want to let you go!

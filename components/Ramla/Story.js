I am 20, and now your 20, oooh wow, that means we are the same age now. I wish you a happy birthday! Ramla, even though I have not known you for a full year, it feels like a lifetime. The first birthday I am going to be spending with you, and not the last I will be there for the rest of them. Ramla, You have been so amazing since the start of our relationship, you have been caring, sweet, and loving. I remember coming home or even just texting you so much from the start. Both you and I would always wait for each other to least respond or also call each other. Ramla, princess, my everything you have been so amazing, you have helped me out so much with many things. You have been so respectful, caring, and loving to me. That is something I cannot stress enough. Ramla, I will always be with you like I have from the start and till forever and ever. I will never stop caring or loving you. Ramla, I am proud that You are now turning 20 years old it is just purely amazing. It is something else. Soon before we know it, we will have our dreams and wishes that we have been waiting for. I have done many things, met many people in my life, but there is one person in this world which strikes my heart into many pieces. I have not met anyone like that in my life until a few months ago, and this person is very beautiful, loving. I can easily say you are my best friend and the closest person I have ever been to in my life. it was just an instant connection from the very start. You renewed my way of life, from love to faith and having the most profound connection. Ramla, the girl who lives in my heart, the girl who makes my heartbeat every second. When I see you, you make me feel nervous and shy because you make me feel like I have never felt before. I stare and look at you in person or call purely stunned. The thoughts in my mind are suddenly gone. The worries, stress, or anything wrong in the world blocked utterly, just like a warm sunset with calming water. The thoughts of you, the memories I have with you, I pray to Allah to never forget, they are the nearest and dear things in this world to me. I love you, and I will never stop loving you as you are the person who runs my heart. The person who keeps me warm, the person who cares about me from the bottom to the top no matter where I am in life, or how I am doing. You keep me as the highest priority in life. I can't lose that girl in my heart that does that. I respect you with everything and will always make my love. I love you. Happy birthday Ramla! XOXO</p>

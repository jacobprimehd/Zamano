But there are some things that really pop out to me that I love about you! Ramla you are very patient, and caring. But, I want to say one thing to you Ramla, I am sorry. I failed on what I agreed on, which is definitely not right on my part. I will do my best not to mess up, I hurt you for doing that. I made you bored, and wait for me, which is completely wrong to do on my part. That was mean and cruel of me to do, especially for a person that cares about me. I know what I need to work on. Ramla keeps up the good work in school, you are doing an amazing job! I am really proud of you, I can even express it in words on how amazed I am! xoxo</p>
